1) What is the definition of server port?
In computer networking, a port is a communication endpoint. 
Physical as well as wireless connections are terminated at ports 
of hardware devices. At the software level, within an operating system, 
a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process 
or a type of network service. Ports are identified for each protocol 
and address combination by 16-bit unsigned numbers, commonly known as the port number. 
The most common protocols that use port numbers are the 
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).


2) What is server port range?
Server port range is from 0 to 65535.
0 to 1023 are reserved for privileged services and designated as well-known ports.
Registered ports are in the range 1024 to 49151. 
Dynamic ports are in the range 49152 to 65535.
