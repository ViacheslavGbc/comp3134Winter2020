Exercise 
		
Choose one of these scenario's (places) and describe the procedures using technical terms above

_______________________________________________


I try to log into my gmail.com online mailbox. Electronic badge 
gives out a 10-digit number. A pop-up window or a desktop app 
asks me to provide credentials and the given number.

If entered number is correct, PC sends TCP synchronisation request 
to destination mail server's service port. Secure client IMAP SSL protocol 
is used for this purpose. The port address is 993. 

Remote server responds with Syn/acknowledgement packet. 
PC responds with own achnoledgement to the destination port address 2096.
Remote server breaks initial data into packets using TCP 
and sends them over the Internet at the physical level.

Each packet contains a checksum so local machine can verify 
that packet arrived successfully and it is intact 
while TCP reassembles original emails locally. 
Window size of a packet is set to 16 bits.

At the same time outbound mail messages are being asynchronously sent 
through a secure client SMTP SSL protocol using port 587. Checksums of the appropriate arriving packets
are verified by the destination mail server respectively. At the end of a web session local machine breaks connection according to the procedure similar to described earlier. Current 10-digit numerical access code is ceased by the system and it is not valid any more.
