1) Navigate to the form and type a valid English word. 
Web app does routing by adding to the initial URL  
"https://www.dictionary.com" some extra parameters, like 
"/browse/lysin?s=t" for the word "lysin", for example.


2) Navigate to the URL and type an invalid English word after the `/browse/` section of the URL. 
An extra part like "misspelling?term=wtfit" is added to URL.


3) Navigate to the form and type the following text: <script>alert(%27hello%27)</script>
Result would be something like 
"https://www.dictionary.com/noresult?term=<script>alert(%27hello%27)<%2Fscript>&s=ts27hello%27)</script>
Some search results for word "hello" are displayed on the page.


4)Navigate to the URL and type the following text: <script>alert(%27hello%27)</script>
after the `term=` section of the URL.

The result is pretty much exactly like the previous one, just missing some html elements 
https://www.dictionary.com/noresult?term=<script>alert(%27hello%27)</script>
even though a pop-up window is expected to appear)
